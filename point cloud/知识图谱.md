# Graph Notebook: easily query and visualize graphs
The graph notebook provides an easy way to interact with graph databases using Jupyter notebooks. Using this open-source Python package, you can connect to any graph database that supports the [Apache TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/), [openCypher](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher) or the [RDF SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) graph models. These databases could be running locally on your desktop or in the cloud. Graph databases can be used to explore a variety of use cases including [knowledge graphs](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/knowledge-graphs-on-aws/) and [identity graphs](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/identity-graphs-on-aws/).
