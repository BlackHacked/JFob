### Step 1: Remove the Nvidia Driver

Let's purge all NVIDIA packages including nvidia-common, run the following command.
```cobol
$ sudo apt purge nvidia-* 
$ sudo apt purge libnvidia-*
```

If the relevant packages have been cleared, the output of the following command will be empty.
```cobol
$ dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia
```
>if the output is not empty, reset regex to purge the rest packages

### Step 2: Find available driver versions

We can use Ubuntu's own driver management tool ubuntu-drivers devices to query the drivers recommended by the current version of Ubuntu.

```cobol
$ ubuntu-drivers devices
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/0000:02:08.0/0000:03:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd000013BBsv000010DEsd00001098bc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GM107GL [Quadro K620]
driver   : nvidia-driver-535 - distro non-free recommended
driver   : nvidia-driver-450-server - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-390 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-525 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-525-server - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-470-server - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-470 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-535-server - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-418-server - distro non-free
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin
```
The output is as above, and the word "recommended" appears in one line, which means that the system recommends this driver, which is nvidia-driver-535.

### Step 3: Reinstall the Correct Driver

#### Solution 1
To install the recommended driver, run the following command.

```cobol
$ sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
```
#### Solution 2 
Also, you can execute the following command to automatically install the recommended version driver. At this time, the above recommended version driver will be automatically installed on the machine.

```cobol
$ sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
```

#### Solution 3
离线安装

#### Solution 4
图形界面安装

### Step 5: Restart the System

Reboot the machine for the changes to take effect.

```cobol
$ sudo reboot
```
