# 方法一
把renderer改成network manager
检查发现已经是了

```bash
cat /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
```

```yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: NetworkManager
  ethernets:
```

Also, worth mentioning that `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` file should have access rights/mode where `others` cannot read the file. So, you may want to:

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
```
